 		<p>
 			I'm actually studying in Lille at the IESEG School. I'm in first year in the English section because I want to improve my english to be bilingual before going to the exchange semester in third year.

 		<h2>About me... ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>
 		<p>
 			I'm 18 and from Lille. I moved 4 times before arriving to Lille with my family due to the work of my dad but these experiences of changing house, city and friends have been really useful in my everyday-life. Indeed, I'm now adaptale in any situation and I don't fear the future and new things.

 		<h2>Sport üéæ</h2>
 		<p>
 			I love sport, indeed, I've been praticing kayak for 10 years now and I like to do musculation when I have time.
 			But due to the amount of work we have with IESEG, I stopped the kayak. I'm quite sad but I think I'll start again in my second year.

 		<h2>Music üéµ</h2>
 		<p>
 			I enjoy being the DJ at friend's parties but I'm still learning for the moment. I like techno and rap songs like the majority of students but also like to be resting in a park with guitar songs when it's summer. This is such a vibe !
